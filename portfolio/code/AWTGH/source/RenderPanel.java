/**
 * A Swing panel that manages and displays output from a {@link GraphicsProcessor} instance.
 * <p>
 * {@code RenderPanel} serves as the administrative layer between the user and the
 * rendering engine. It creates and owns a {@link GraphicsProcessor}, handles the
 * Swing-side display of completed frames, and ensures that the dedicated threads
 * are safely disposed of.
 * <p>
 * The parent {@link JFrame}'s default close operation should be set to
 * {@link javax.swing.WindowConstants#EXIT_ON_CLOSE} or
 * {@link javax.swing.WindowConstants#DISPOSE_ON_CLOSE}.
 * The panel registers a {@link java.awt.event.WindowListener} to call {@link #stop()}
 * on the {@code windowClosed}.
 * <p>
 * It is worth noting that this panel does not require a parent component to function.
 * The JPanel can function as an output in itself.
